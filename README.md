This is a family recipe that somehow my Jewish, New Yorker family holds very dear. A true piece of American assimilation that's become a huge part of our traditions and so I want to share it. We cook this for thanksgiving but it's too good to only eat once a year. It's also super easy to make and doing it with frozen pie crusts doesn't ruin anything. 

Also if you have alterations or suggestions please post them as issues or submit a PR!

## Recipe 

2 frozen pie shells (can make your own too)
3 to 4 large yams
3 eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 stick butter
1/4 t. nutmeg
1/8 t. cinnamon
1/8 t. white pepper
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup white sugar

1. Preheat oven to 350F

2. If using frozen pie shells pre-bake ~15min after pricking holes in bottoms.

3. Peel and boil yams until soft. 

4. Put all ingredients except milk and eggs into food processor and blend. Make sure potatoes are still warm and cut butter into small pieces when you add. 

5. Slowly add milk and eggs (beaten first). 

6. Pour in pie shell and bake at 350 for 75 min (check at 45min to 1hr)  or until top is slightly brown and cracks. Use cake pin to make sure when you stick it nothing sticks to pin.

7. Happy thanksgiving! ðŸ¦ƒ ðŸ¦ƒ ðŸ¦ƒ
